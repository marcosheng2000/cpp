# C++ Algorithm Practice

This repository contains selected C++ algorithm problems with English descriptions and implementations.

These problems reflect the current progress of learning C++ and algorithmic problem solving.

## Longest Balanced Fence Segment
You are given a binary array representing red and blue fence bars (0 = red, 1 = blue). Find the length of the longest contiguous segment in which the number of red and blue bars are equal.

## Maximum Minimum Jump Distance After Removing Rocks
Given a river of width m with n rocks positioned in it, you are allowed to remove up to k rocks. Your goal is to maximize the minimum distance one has to jump between remaining rocks. Output this maximum possible minimum distance.

## Minimum Maximum Gap After Adding Road Signs
Given a road of length D with N existing road signs, you are allowed to add up to K additional signs. You want to minimize the maximum distance between any two consecutive signs.

## Minimum Minutes to Reach Critical Damage Threshold
There are n critical components. Each component has an initial damage level a[i] and increases by b[i] each minute. When a componentâ€™s damage exceeds threshold x, it becomes completely broken. Find the minimum number of minutes until at least m components become completely broken.
